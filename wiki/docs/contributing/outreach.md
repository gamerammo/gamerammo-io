# Community Outreach & Marketing
Any communications efforts are welcomed, and it's necessary that any contributions that represent Status are closely aligned of our [Mission & Core Values](../getting-started/mission-and-core-values.md). Brand messaging needs to be consistent, honest, transparent and accurately reflect what the project aims to achieve.

Status is not yet ready for mass-adoption, and a clearly defined a user acquisition strategy will be outlined here at a later date. For the time being, contributors interested helping with community outreach should focus on helping to produce meaningful content and spreading the word amongst other blockchain enthusiasts. Some practical tips and suggestions on how you can take part in and help to strengthen our community can be found at the [Growing our Community](../community/how-to-grow-our-community.md) page.
